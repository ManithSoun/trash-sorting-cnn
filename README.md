# trash-sorting-cnn
Machine learning course final project 

Project Overview: 

Waste generation is growing rapidly due to urbanization and increased consumption. Manual waste sorting is slow, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. This project aims to design a low-cost, automated smart waste management system using:

A lightweight CNN model for image classification

An IoT device with a microcontroller + camera

A servo-based sorting mechanism

Real-time feedback to guide proper waste disposal

The goal is to build a practical prototype that can classify 12 waste categories, auto-sort items, and be deployable in households, schools, or small community recycling centers.

Research Gap

Lack of real-world datasets

Limited user guidance (only label prediction)

No full end-to-end prototype combining CNN + IoT
